Live kernel patching
=========================

Your company is in a period of high volume business critical activity and cannot afford the risk of taking down either of the HANA hosts for maintenance however you have just been advised of a critical kernel vulnerability.

RHEL versions 7.7 and 8.1 introduced live kernel patching functionality via kpatch for all subscriptions, which allows for select critical and important security kernel patches to be applied without a reboot.

Overview
========

In this lab exercise, you will identify vulnerable systems and automatically apply live kernel patches on your lab instances.

Logging into Tower
==================

Your Ansible Tower instance url and credentials were supplied to you on the page created for this workshop.

Identifying Vulnerable Systems
======================

For your lab environment, there are 2 smart inventories are pre-created:

- RHEL 8 - (List of all RHEL 8 systems)
- RHEL 8 - Vulnerable (List of all vulnerable systems)

First, run **Lab 4 - Check Vulnerabilities** job template to identify any vulnerable systems.

Step 1:
-------

Select **TEMPLATES**

Step 2:
-------

Click the rocketship icon ![Add](images/at_launch_icon.png) for the
**Lab 4 - Check Vulnerabilities**

Step 3:
-------

When prompted, select **cve_2019_11135**

**Note:** For more information on this vulnerability: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11135

![Survey Prompt](images/4-survey-prompt.png)

Step 4:
-------

Select **NEXT** and preview the inputs.

Step 5:
-------

Select LAUNCH ![SurveyL](images/4-survey-launch.png)

Step 6:
-------

Sit back, watch the magic happen

One of the first things you will notice is the summary section. This
gives you details about your job such as who launched it, what playbook
itâ€™s running, what the status is, i.e. pending, running, or complete.

![Job Summary](images/4-job-summary-details.png)

Next you will be able to see details on the play and each task in the
playbook.

Step 7:
-------

When the job has successfully completed, you should see which systems are vulnerable (yes/no).

Validating Smart Inventory
======================

Step 1:
-------

After running the job template, results will be now reflected in the inventory **RHEL 8 - Vulnerable**.

Navigate to **INVENTORIES**

Step 2:
-------

Click **Lab 4 - RHEL 8 - Vulnerable**.

Step 3:
-------

Review **SMART HOST FILTER** field, it's only listing RHEL 8.1 vulnerable systems.

Step 4:
-------

Click the **HOSTS** tab and review the system(s) listed.

Fixing Vulnerable Systems
======================

Now that you verified the vulnerable systems, you can run the **Lab 4 - Live Kernel Patch** job template to update those systems without distrbuting the services running.

Step 1:
-------

Select **TEMPLATES**

Step 2:
-------

Click the rocketship icon ![Add](images/at_launch_icon.png) for the
**Lab 4 - Live Kernel Patch**

Step 3:
-------

When prompted, confirm Limit and click **Next**.

Step 4:
-------

Click **LAUNCH**.

Step 5:
-------

When the job has successfully completed, you should see the systems that are patched in the details view:

![Play and Task Output](images/4-job-summary-output-2.png)

Re-checking Vulnerable Systems
======================

After running the **Lab 4 - Live Kernel Patch** job template, all systems should patched and vulnerabilities should be gone.

Step 1:
-------

Select **TEMPLATES** and re-run **Lab 4 - Check Vulnerabilities**

Step 2:
-------

After answering the survey question and running, validate that systems are not vulnerable anymore.

Step 3:
-------

Navigate to **INVENTORIES > Lab 4 - RHEL 8 - Vulnerable** and verify that no hosts are listed in the dynamic inventory.

Challenge Exercise: Putting it all together
======================

Wouldn't it be nice if you could put this all together in a nice Workflow (potentially with an approval step) so that you wouldn't need to run through individual job templates manually.

In this exercise you will create a workflow template for checking, fixing and validating vulnerable systems.

Step 1:
-------

Navigate to **TEMPLATES**.

Step 2:
-------

Click the ![Add](images/add.png) icon and select **Workflow Template**

Step 3:
-------

Complete the form using the following values (leaving other fields blank):

| Key          | Value                                        | Note |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|------|
| Name         | Lab 4 - Validate and Patch Vulnerabilities   |      |
| Description  | Template for fixing vulnerabilities          |      |
| Organization | Default                                      |      |


![Create Workflow Template](images/4-create-workflow-template.png)

Step 4:
-------

Select SAVE ![Add](images/at_save.png)

Step 5:
-------

You will see and empty canvas where you can start including job templates.

Select START ![Start](images/at_start.png)

Step 6:
-------

In **ADD A NODE** dialog box on the right side of the window, select **Lab 4 - Check Vulnerabilities**

![Add Lab 4 - Check Vulnerabilities Job Template](images/4-wf-add-validate-patch-jt.png)

Step 7:
-------

Click PROMPT ![Prompt](images/at_prompt.png)

Step 8:

In **ADD A NODE** dialog box on the right side of the window, select **Lab 4 - Live Kernel Patch**

![Add Lab 4 - Live Kernel Patch Job Template](images/4-wf-add-live-kernel-patch-jt.png)

Step 13:
--------

Click SELECT ![Select](images/at_select.png)

Step 14:
--------

Repeat steps 6-10 and add **Lab 4 - Check Vulnerabilities** again as the 3rd node.

![Workflow Template](images/4-wf-template-1.png)

Step 15:
-------

Select SAVE ![Save](images/at_save.png)

Step 16:
-------

Back on the main Workflow Template page, select SAVE
![Save](images/at_save.png) again.

Running Validate and Patch Vulnerabilities Workflow Template
======================

Now you can test the Workflow template that you just created.

Step 1:
-------

Select **TEMPLATES**

Step 2:
-------

Click the rocketship icon ![Add](images/at_launch_icon.png) for the
**Lab 4 - Validate and Patch Vulnerabilities**

Alternatively, you can click LAUNCH ![Launch](images/at_launch_bt.png) on the Workflow Template view.

Step 3:
-------

After you launch the workflow template, you will see the top-level view:

![Workflow Template](images/4-wf-job-view.png)

You can click "Details" on individual nodes to see the detailed view of jobs as the nodes gets run

Step 4:
-------

Review the details of each node, are the results as expected? Any vulnerability found?

**Hint**: Vulnerabilities were previously fixed on all HANA servers but not on the S4 host (sap2vm01).

Challenge Exercise: Add S4 host to list of hosts and add approval step in the workflow
======================

In this challenge exercise, you will incorporate S4 host into the limit, add an approval node in the workflow and re-run.

This time add S4 host (sap2vm01) to the limit to check and potentially fix any vulnerabilities.

**Hint**: You can either change the limit for both 'Lab 4 - Check Vulnerabilities' and 'Lab 4 - Live Kernel Patch' job templates (i.e. tag_role_s4app).

**Hint**: You can add an approval node to the canvas by selecting 'Approval Node' from the drop down as opposed to 'Template'.
