# SAP HANA Workshop

This workshop is intended to demostrate the power of the Red Hat Platform protfolio (RHEL, Smart Management and Ansible Tower) for deploying and maintaining an SAP HANA solution as well as providing the ability for operations or developer teams to deploy consistent sandbox image without taking time away from, or having to wait for, members of multiple infrastucture teams. 

## Presentations

The presenter deck is available here:
[SAP HANA Workshop](../decks/sap_hana_workshop.pdf)

All playbooks for the labs are found in this repository (provisioner)

## Time planning

The time required to do the workshops strongly depends on a couple factors: the number of participants and how much discussions are done in between.

Having said that, the exercises themselves should take roughly 4-5 hours. The accompanying presentation itself adds another hour.

If your experience is different in scheduling these workshops, please let us know and file an issue.

Unless otherwise noted, all lab exercises should be performed in the order documented for consistent experience.

## Exercises

- [Exercise 1 - Deploying RHEL and SAP HANA](1-deploy)
- [Exercise 2 - Establishing an HA Cluster](2-ha-cluster)
- [Exercise 3 - Ensure compliance](3-compliance)
- [Exercise 4 - Live kernel patching](4-live-kernel)
- [Exercise 5 - Zero downtime patching](5-zero-downtime)
