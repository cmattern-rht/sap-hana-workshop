Zero downtime patching
=========================

Your company is now out of the critical phase experienced in the previous lab and itâ€™s time for monthly patching.
Key requirement here is to perform patching without disrupting services running and automatically perform OS and application patches while rebooting and keeping the services up & running in HA configuration.

In a real world environment, you can also incorporate any manual steps that may be required into the workflow process, for example HW upgrade or fixes.
