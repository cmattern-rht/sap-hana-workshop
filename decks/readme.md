## Google Slides

All slides are currently managed internally at Red Hat with Google Slides.

**Why use Google Slides?**

More than 30% of the slides are graphics, flow charts, icons, diagrams, etc which were uploaded as SVG files.  This became way too much of a barrier to manage individual SVG files, and slides quickly fell out of date and required someone skilled in using Adobe or other graphics programs to edit the SVG file.  By using the internal Red Hat IT tools (which use Google Apps) this makes it very easy for the field engineers and Solution Architects, as well as the Red Hat Ansible team to manage slides.  We do realize this can potentially make it harder for community members but we were getting very little PRs, issues, etc on the slides.

**Can I still contribute?**

Yes!  Google Apps is free, just make a slide with your free Google Apps account and link to the slide deck on an Issue for this Github repository.
